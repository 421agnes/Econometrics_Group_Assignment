# Convert "Budapest 01. ker." → "Budapest I. kerület" in 'Locality name'
# In the Localities dataset, Budapest districts are written with Arabic numerals (e.g. "Budapest 01. ker." or "Budapest 11. ker.").
# In the main fuel price data, however, these are identified with Roman numerals (e.g. "Budapest I. kerület", "Budapest XI. kerület").
# To ensure a successful match between the 'Settlement' column in the main data and the 'Locality name' column in the Localities file, all Budapest district names are converted from Arabic to Roman numerals, following the format used in the main dataset.
# Without this harmonization, Budapest districts would fail to join correctly and their population or dwelling data would be missing (NA) after the merge.

# Collapse any "Budapest NN. ker." in 'District name' to "Budapest"
# The 'District name' column is later used to connect district-level statistics (e.g. tourism nights, average earnings) to each settlement.
# However, these datasets contain only one aggregated record for the whole of Budapest.
# Therefore, every Budapest district is replaced by a single common label "Budapest" in the 'District name' field.
